ðŸ”° Azure Data Engineering Bootcamp Project! ðŸŒŸ
I recently completed an end-to-end Azure Data Engineering project as part of a bootcamp, leveraging cutting-edge tools and methodologies to build a robust, scalable, and efficient data pipeline. Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what I accomplished:
ðŸ”° Tech Stack Highlights:
 âœ… Azure Data Factory (ADF) â€“ for orchestrating and managing ETL workflows
âœ… Databricks with Unity Catalog â€“ for data transformation and advanced analytics using PySpark
âœ… Apache Spark â€“ for scalable and distributed data processing
âœ… Delta Lake â€“ for implementing ACID transactions and incremental data loading
âœ… Azure Data Lake â€“ for centralized and secure data storage
âœ… Azure SQL Database â€“ for seamless API-based data ingestion
âœ… GitHub â€“ for version control and collaboration
ðŸ”° Architecture: Designed and implemented the Medallion Architecture:
Bronze Layer: Ingested raw data via API into Azure SQL Database, processed through ADF for incremental loading.
Silver Layer: Transformed and cleansed data in Databricks using PySpark, stored as Parquet files.
Gold Layer: Modeled data into Delta Tables for analytical purposes, enabling dimensional modeling with a STAR Schema.
ðŸ”° Complex Real-Time Scenarios Solved: âœ… Incremental Data Loading: Efficiently loaded only the updated data to minimize processing time and storage usage.
âœ… Dimensional Data Modeling: Designed a STAR schema to optimize query performance for analytics.
âœ… Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 1): Implemented SCD logic to handle historical data changes in the Gold Layer.
ðŸ”° Final Touch: Integrated the Gold Layer with Power BI for dynamic dashboards and insightful reporting.
